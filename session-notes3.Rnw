\section*{Question 1}
An experimenter has collected 40 samples of size 250 for the purpose of constructing trial control limits on a p-chart and finds that p-bar = .016.
 




\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\alph{enumi}}
\begin{enumerate}
\item What motivation, if any, would there be for using a transformation such as $ y = arcsin(\sqrt{\sfrac{(x+\sfrac{3}{8})}{(n+\sfrac{3}{4})}})  $ for this problem? 
  \item Determine the control limits using that transformation.
\end{enumerate}

a.	What motivation, if any, would there be for using a transformation such as y = sin-1 âˆš[(x+3/8) / (n+3/4)] for this problem? b.	Determine the control limits using that transformation.

\subsection*{answer}

\subsubsection*{part a}
 In general the LCL generated from the untranformed binomial model has a tail area less than .00135. The tranform is used to imprved the lower tail are while keeping the upper tail are near 0.00135. 

\subsubsection*{part b}
<<q1_partb,echo=T>>=

tpLimits <- function(p,n) { formatC(asin(sqrt(p)) + c(-1,1)*3/(2*sqrt(n)),digits=5)}

tpLimits(0.016,250)

tpLimits(0.1,400)

\section*{Question 2}
Overdispersion is frequently a problem when an attributes control chart is used. Explain how you would test for overdispersion before constructing a p-chart.

\subsection*{answer}


 Compare the value of $n\bar{p}(1 -\bar{p}) $ to { \large$ \sum{ \frac{(X -\bar{X})^2}{n}} $}.
  These calculations should be in within a order of magitude.

\section*{Question 3}
Assume that you wanted to construct a c-chart but you decided that you should transform the data. Which transformation should you use, or does it make any difference? Explain.

\subsection*{notes}

 See section 6.2.2
 
 
 \subsection*{answer}
 
  Any of the three following transformation will work and generally provide a non-zero LCL.  The controls are $\pm3$ of the mean of the transformed value. Each transform forces the varaiance to be 1.   
\begin{itemize}
\item  $y_0=2\sqrt{c} $ 
\item $y_1=2\sqrt{c +\sfrac{3}{8}} $ 
\item $y_2=\sqrt{c} +\sqrt{c+1} $ 
\end{itemize}


\section*{Question 4}
What is the LCL for a 3-sigma Shewhart c-chart when c-bar = 6.45? If there is a problem with this value but you still want to plot the number of nonconformities and use this chart, what could you do to correct the problem?


\subsection*{answer}
  The issue with $\bar{c}$ of 6.45 is the LCL will not exist.  Using a transformation such as  $y_2=\sqrt{c} +\sqrt{c+1} $ creates a useful LCL.
