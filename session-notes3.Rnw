\section*{Question 1}
An experimenter has collected 40 samples of size 250 for the purpose of constructing trial control limits on a p-chart and finds that p-bar = .016.

\begin{enumerate}
\item What motivation, if any, would there be for using a transformation such as $ y = arcsin(\sqrt{\sfrac{(x+\sfrac{3}{8})}{(n+\sfrac{3}{4})}})  $ for this problem? 
  \item Determine the control limits using that transformation.
\end{enumerate}

a.	What motivation, if any, would there be for using a transformation such as y = sin-1 âˆš[(x+3/8) / (n+3/4)] for this problem? b.	Determine the control limits using that transformation.

\subsection*{a}
 In general the LCL generated from the untranformed binomial model has a tail area less than .00135. The tranform is used to imprved the lower tail are while keeping the upper tail are near 0.00135. 

\subsection*{b}

<<q1_partb,echo=T>>=
tpLimits <- function(p,n) { formatC(asin(sqrt(p)) + c(-1,1)*3/(2*sqrt(n)),digits=5)}

tpLimits(0.016,250)

tpLimits(0.1,400)

\section*{Question 2}
Overdispersion is frequently a problem when an attributes control chart is used. Explain how you would test for overdispersion before constructing a p-chart.


\section*{Question 3}
Assume that you wanted to construct a c-chart but you decided that you should transform the data. Which transformation should you use, or does it make any difference? Explain.


\section*{Question 4}
What is the LCL for a 3-sigma Shewhart c-chart when c-bar = 6.45? If there is a problem with this value but you still want to plot the number of nonconformities and use this chart, what could you do to correct the problem?
